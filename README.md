## Currently, the project only supports self-building


```bash
git clone https://github.com/lurenjia534/SkyDrive-X-for-Android
```

Find the following in the project's `AndroidManifest.xml`

```
<activity android:name="com.microsoft.identity.client.BrowserTabActivity"
            android:exported="true">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
                <data
                    android:host="com.lurenjia534.nextonedrivev2"
                    android:path="/<YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PACKAGE_SIGNATURE>"
                    android:scheme="msauth" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
```

Replace `<YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PACKAGE_SIGNATURE>` with the Base64 encoded hash value of your application's signing certificate

### 下一步

```json
{
  "client_id": "<YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME>",
  "redirect_uri": "msauth://com.lurenjia534.nextonedrivev2/<YOUR_BASE64_URL_ENCODED_PACKAGE_SIGNATURE>",
  "broker_redirect_uri_registered": true
}

```

Where `<YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME>` is your client ID 
Replace `<YOUR_BASE64_URL_ENCODED_PACKAGE_SIGNATURE>` with the Base64 URL-safe encoded hash value of your application's signing certificate
